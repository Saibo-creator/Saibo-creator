# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

- ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m currently a PhD student in CS at EPFL [Data Science Lab](https://dlab.epfl.ch/)
- ðŸŒ± My research interest is **reliable and controllable LLM generation via constrained decoding**
- ðŸ¤— I contribute to the open-source community in my spare time.
- ðŸ”¬ Iâ€™m always looking for motivated master's students interested in my research
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: if you want to work with me on a semester project or master thesis, have a look at [openings](https://dlab.epfl.ch/openings/) and feel free to drop an email


## My Open Source Projects on Github

- [Transformers-CFG](https://github.com/epfl-dlab/transformers-CFG): A library to extend Huggingface Transformers with constrained decoding methods for LLM
- [Awesome-LLM-Constrained-Decoding](https://github.com/Saibo-creator/Awesome-LLM-Constrained-Decoding): A curated list of papers and resources on constrained decoding methods for LLM
- [JsonSchemaBench](https://github.com/guidance-ai/jsonschemabench): The first systematic investigation into the performance of constrained decoding frameworks for LLM, alo available on [EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/tree/main/lm_eval/tasks/jsonschema_bench)
- [JsonSchemaBench-Leaderboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gloUwsKiiOgrBmxbNluh-2_-vV_6RgaPji6KAD52pv0/edit?usp=sharing): Tracking the evolution of LLM capacity on structured generation.
